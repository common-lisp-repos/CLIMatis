CLIM II input handling. 

In 8.1, the spec says that a sheet either participates fully in the
input protocol (which I take to mean that that any function in the
input protocol can be called with such a sheet as an argument), or is
mute for input, which means that if any function in the input protocol
is called on such a sheet, and error is signaled.
