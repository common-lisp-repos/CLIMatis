\chapter{Introduction}

This document currently contains both a specification of a suggested
successor to \climtwo{} called \clim{}, and documentation for an
initial implementation of the \clim{} specification, called
\sysname{}.  

Since both \clim{} and \sysname{} represent work in progress, it is
somewhat ambiguous at this point which functionality should be
considered part of \clim{} and which functionality should be part of
\sysname{} only.  As work progresses, the distinction between the two
will be clarified. 

\climtwo{} is in many respects a very good specification.  We believe,
however, that the reason for many design decisions were related to
limitations of the performance of computers at the time the
specification was written; limitations that are much less severe these
days.

For that reason, with \clim{}, we have attempted to simplify many
aspects of the \climtwo{} specification, often according to the
\emph{issues} that are listed in it.  One major such simplification is
that we have merged three concepts: \emph{sheet}, \emph{output-record}
and \emph{design} (to some degree).

Because both \clim{} and \sysname{} are work in progress, the
terminology of this document should be considered preliminary.
