\chapter{Input events}
\label{chap-input-events}

Input events are handled in two different ways; either globally for
the application or by some zone.  

Currently, two types of input processing are done by zones, namely
detecting when the pointer enters or leaves some zone
\seesec{sec-zones-input-visit} and determining the position of the
pointer. \seesec{sec-zones-input-motion}

Keyboard events and pointer button events are handled globally.

\section{Handling keyboard events}

Two generic functions are involved in handling keyboard events:

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{handle-key-press}
\item \code{handle-key-release}
\end{itemize}

These two generic functions are called whenever the corresponding
input event is detected.  These functions take tree arguments:

\begin{itemize}
\item A \emph{handler} object.
\item The \emph{key code} of the key involved.
\item The \emph{modifier state} at the time the event happened.
\end{itemize}

The handler object should be an instance of the class
\code{key-handler}.  The user may create subclasses of this classes,
and add methods on these generic functions specialized for those
subclasses.

The \emph{key code} and the \emph{modifier state} are backend specific
values.  Users can write backend-specific handlers, but \clim{}
provides functionality for turning these values into
backend-independent objects.

Whenever the backend detects a key-press event, it calls the function
\code{handle-key-press} passing it the value of the special variable
\code{*key-handler*}, the key code, and the modifier state. 

Similarly, whenever the backend detects a key-release event, it calls
the function \code{handle-key-release}, again passing it the value of
the special variable \code{*key-handler*}, the key code, and the
modifier state.

The global value of the variable \code{*key-handler*} is the global
value of another variable named \code{*null-key-handler*} which
contains an instance of the class \code{null-key-handler}.  A default
method on \code{handle-key-press} specialized for the
\code{null-key-handler} class exists, and it does nothing.  Similarly,
a default method on \code{handle-key-release} specialized for the
\code{null-key-handler} class exists, and it does nothing.

As mentioned above, \clim{} provides functionality for turning the
\emph{key code} and the \emph{modifier state} into backend-independent
objects.  For this purpose, \clim{} provides a function
\code{standard-key-processor}.  This function calls the generic
function \code{port-standard-key-processor} which has methods for each
backend.  The function \code{standard-key-processor} takes a \emph{key
  code} and a \emph{modifier} and returns a \cl{} \emph{character}
corresponding to the two backend-specific arguments. 

A class \code{read-keystroke-handler} exists, and it takes a
\code{:receiver} initarg.  This initarg should be a function of one
argument, a \emph{character}.  A method exists on
\code{handle-key-press} specialized for \code{read-keystroke-handler}
which calls the receiver function with a character that corresponds to
the key that was pressed.  The corresponding method on
\code{handle-key-press} does nothing.  To transform the key-press
event into a character, the method on \code{handle-key-press} calls
the function \code{standard-key-processor} discussed above.

\section{Handling pointer button events}

Two generic functions are involved in handling pointer button events:

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{handle-button-press}
\item \code{handle-button-release}
\end{itemize}

These two generic functions are called whenever the corresponding
input event is detected.  These functions take tree arguments:

\begin{itemize}
\item A \emph{handler} object.
\item The \emph{button code} of the button involved.
\item The \emph{modifier state} at the time the event happened.
\end{itemize}

The handler object should be an instance of the class
\code{button-handler}.  The user may create subclasses of this class,
and add methods on these generic functions specialized for those
subclasses.

The \emph{button code} and the \emph{modifier state} are backend
specific values.  Users can write backend-specific handlers, but
\clim{} provides functionality for turning these values into
backend-independent objects. 

Whenever the backend detects a button-press event, it calls the function
\code{handle-button-press} passing it the value of the special variable
\code{*button-handler*}, the button code, and the modifier state. 

Similarly, whenever the backend detects a button-release event, it calls
the function \code{handle-button-release}, again passing it the value of
the special variable \code{*button-handler*}, the button code, and the
modifier state.

The global value of the variable \code{*button-handler*} is the global
value of another variable named \code{*null-button-handler*} which
contains an instance of the class \code{null-button-handler}.  A
default method on \code{handle-button-press} specialized for the
\code{null-button-handler} class exists, and it does nothing.  Similarly,
a default method on \code{handle-button-release} specialized for the
\code{null-button-handler} class exists, and it does nothing.
