\chapter{Preliminaries}

This document is work in progress.  It contains some ideas about the
successor of \climtwo{}, the Common Lisp Interface Manager.  \climtwo{} is in
many respects a very good specification.  We believe, however, that
the reason for many design decisions were related to limitations of
the performance of computers at the time the specification was
written; limitations that are much less severe these days.  

We have attempted to simplify many aspects of the \climtwo{}
specification, often according to the \emph{issues} that are listed in
it.  One major such simplification is that we have merged three
concepts: \emph{sheet}, \emph{output-record} and \emph{design} (to
some degree).
