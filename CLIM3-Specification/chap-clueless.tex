\chapter{The Clueless inspector}

The \emph{Clueless} inspector is an inspector modeled after the SLIME
inspector.  As such, it shows a single object%
\footnote{Here, a list is considered a single object.}
at one time.

Two commands are available as keyboard shortcuts: `q' for quitting and
`l' for returning to the previous object inspected.  Temporarily, we
also include the shortcut `i' for recursively inspecting the zone
hierarchy of the inspector itself.
