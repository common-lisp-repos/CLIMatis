\chapter{Command loop}

\clim{} maintains a \emph{command loop} as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Acquire a \emph{command object}.
\item Acquire the arguments of the command object.
\item Execute the command object on the arguments.
\item Call \code{redisplay} on the top zone.  The result of calling
  \code{redisplay} might be a new zone or the same zone, modified
  or unchanged.  The behavior of redisplay on a particular zone
  depends on the exact subclass of the zone.
\item Update the visible area of the screen according to the new
  zone hierarchy.
\end{itemize}
